AIO App.
AIO is an all-in-one application that aims to promote sustainable living by providing users with access to information, resources, and tools to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations for Google Solution challenge. The app will be designed to help users make more conscious choices and take actions that positively impact the environment, society, and economy.

Features
AIO offers a variety of features to help users achieve the SDGs, including:

Sustainable lifestyle tips and guides
Challenges and quizzes to test and improve sustainability knowledge
Carbon footprint calculator to track personal impact on the environment
Information on local sustainable initiatives and events
Tools to connect with local organizations and community members
Donation options to support sustainable projects and initiatives
Integration with social media platforms to share sustainability accomplishments and challenges
How Machine Learning Helps
AIO leverages the power of machine learning to provide personalized recommendations and insights to users. By analyzing user behavior and preferences, the app can suggest tailored content and actions to help users achieve their sustainability goals.

The AIO concept was inspired by Google's vision of providing developers with all the necessary tools in a single workstation. As a Nigerian, I am acutely aware of the challenges facing my community and country with respect to the 17 SDGs. Given that these goals are interdependent, my approach is to address all of them through the AIO initiative.
